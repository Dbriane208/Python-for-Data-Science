# Python-for-Data-Science
Machine Learning and Data Science repository. This repository contains machine learning projects from begginer to advance. By the end one will understand how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using python and jupyter notebook. 

# Steps followed in creating the project
1. Form a hypothesis
2. Find and explore the data
3. Do data pre-processing
4. Do data visualization
5. Train the model

# Installation
To follow through the projects you need to have the following tools in your device :
1. Python 3+ locally
2. Python packages
   - Pandas
   - Numpy
   - Seaborn
   - Matplotlib
  
# The Data Science and Machine Learning workflow
The Data science workflow consists of :
   1. Scope of the project : This clearly tells the aim of the project and directions the project will take.
   2. Gathering Data : A project is as strong as the underlying data. It is the foundation of analysis. Data sources included files,Databases, Websites,APIs.
   3. Cleaning Data : It is important in producing accurate and relieable results. Data cleaning tasks include :
          - Correcting data types
          - Imputing missing data
          - Dealing with inconsistent data
          - Reformating the data
   4. Exploring Data : Explatory data analysis helps in understanding and visualizing the data your're working with. EDA tasks may include :
          - Slicing and dicing the data
          - Summarizing the data
          - Visualizing the data
   5. Modeling Data : Involves structuring and preparing data for specific modelling techniques and applying models to make predictions. Data modelling tasks include:
          - Restructuring the data
          - Feature engineering (adding new fields)
          - Applying Machine Learning Algorithms
   6. Sharing Insights : Involves summarizing your key findings and sharing insights with end users and stakeholders.
          - Reiterate the problem
          - Interprate the results of your analysis
          - Share recommendations and insights
          - Focus on potential impact and not technical deatails
          - Deploying the model or put it into production
